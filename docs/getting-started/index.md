# Getting Started

Welcome to the Iglesia Jerusalem Production System! This guide will help you learn how to operate the church's audio, video, and streaming equipment.

## What You'll Learn

This section covers everything volunteers need to know to run a successful service:

- **[Quick Start Guide](./quick-start)** - The 2-step startup and shutdown process
- **[First Service Walkthrough](./first-service)** - Complete step-by-step guide for your first time

## The Production System

Our production system handles:

- **Audio** - Wireless microphones, mixer control, room and online sound
- **Video** - PTZ camera with presets, ProPresenter slides, OBS recording
- **Streaming** - Live Zoom broadcast with remote participants
- **Control** - Companion tablet interface for easy operation

## Two Startup Scenarios

The system can start automatically on schedule or be started manually:

### Scenario 1: Automatic Startup (Scheduled)

The Shelly smart plugs automatically power on equipment before service time:

1. Equipment powers on automatically (Mac Mini, stage equipment, charging station)
2. You'll see a notification asking you to turn on the projector
3. Turn on the projector with the remote
4. All apps launch automatically after projector detection
5. Wait 10 minutes for Zoom to stabilize (or press ENTER to skip)

### Scenario 2: Manual Startup (Early Arrival)

If you arrive before the automatic schedule triggers:

1. Turn on the projector first
2. Run "Start Service" from the desktop or launcher (Cmd+Space)
3. Apps launch automatically
4. Wait for Zoom stabilization (or skip)

## What Makes Our System Special

### Automation First

Almost everything happens automatically. The system:

- Powers on equipment on schedule
- Detects when the projector is on
- Launches all 9 production applications
- Waits for Zoom to stabilize
- Handles shutdown sequences
- Powers off equipment after service

### Simple Control

The Companion tablet interface provides one-touch buttons for:

- Service modes (Pre-Service, Worship, Sermon, etc.)
- Camera presets (Wide, Pulpit, Worship, etc.)
- Announcements (Birthday, Welcome, etc.)
- Quick mutes (individual mics or all music)
- Zoom management (spotlight participants)

### Safe and Reliable

The system includes safety features:

- Automatic muting prevents feedback
- Schedule holds prevent mid-service power-offs
- Graceful shutdown protects recordings
- Smart power management extends equipment life
