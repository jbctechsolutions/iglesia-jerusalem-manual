- Complete video failure (no camera, no slides)
- Computer won't start at all
- Dangerous equipment behavior (smoke, sparks, burning smell)

### Issues That Can Wait Until After Service

**Call or email AFTER the service for:**
- Minor audio issues (one channel not working perfectly)
- Recording didn't start (service can continue without it)
- Zoom connection issues (local service is fine)
- Something "seemed weird" but service completed OK
- Low disk space warnings
- Computer froze and you had to restart
