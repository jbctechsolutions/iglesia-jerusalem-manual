## Pro Tips for Operations

::: tip Stay Ahead of the Service
Know what's coming next in the service order. Have your finger ready for the next service mode button.
:::

::: tip Watch the Projector
Glance at the projector screen regularly to make sure the right thing is showing (lyrics, camera, announcements).
:::

::: tip Mute Discipline
Mute microphones when not in use to prevent feedback and background noise from going to Zoom.
:::

::: tip Zoom Attention
Check the Zoom window every few minutes - someone may be waiting to be admitted.
:::

::: tip Music Levels
If music is too loud or quiet, navigate to ROOM MIX page to adjust. Pastor can also gesture to you during service.
:::

::: tip Don't Panic
If something goes wrong, the show goes on. Fix what you can quietly. Most issues can be addressed after service.
